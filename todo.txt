1. add unit tests and integration tests with testcontainers
    1.1. validate everything (user registration duplicate username for example)
2. add hibernate
3. add roles text array field for each user and use roles for role based authorization
4. migrate to Spring WebFlux (with coroutines)
5. customize liquibase
        how to run liquibase if there are multiple instances of a server?

--- at some later point in time
1. add readme file
2. request timeout
3. monitoring
4. deployment - docker (jib)
5. graceful shutdown
6. audit log (check API Security in Action 1.5.4 and chapter 3)
7. rate limiting unauthenticated requests to prevent DoS

---
for test, check also maximum inputs for some (or all) fields to prevent DoS
    for example limit password between 8 and 256 chars

if the app calls 3rd party services, we need to log req/res
