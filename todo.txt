    1.1. validate everything (user registration duplicate username for example)
2. add hibernate
3. add roles text array field for each user and use roles for role based authorization
4. migrate to Spring WebFlux (with coroutines)
5. customize liquibase
        how to run liquibase if there are multiple instances of a server?

--- at some later point in time
1. add readme file
2. request timeout
3. monitoring
4. deployment - docker (jib)
5. graceful shutdown
6. audit log (check API Security in Action 1.5.4 and chapter 3)
7. rate limiting unauthenticated requests to prevent DoS

security
    add kid header for key rotation

---
maybe make browser extension or new page like on new tab
make a (flutter) app for notifications
multiple timers (pomodoro), sync on pause and every 5 seconds (/w backend)
journal on habits and tasks, link those like jira links bugs

    week just put in the corresponding day..
